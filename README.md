## About
HELO is a helicopter game clone created with the LÖVE 2D game engine. In trying to get a feel for the basic LÖVE workflow, I decided to tackle building this project from the ground up. Development for this game is still a work-in-progress.  
  


## How to Do the Thing
- Install [LÖVE](https://www.love2d.org)
- Clone the repo and `cd` into it
- Run `love .`
  


## Controls
| Key    | Description                               |
